## I have been passionate
about the world of Alternative Health since 1993, when I first entered massage
school. My learning has never stopped since then.

Taking that first Bowenwork class, was a profoundly positive-life-altering-make-the-world-a-better-place, kind of decision. I feel blessed and am thankful that this is the work I'm sharing with the world.

I knew that I had found something that was
going to change my life and the life of the people I work with. Bowenwork has
helped my clients in ways that I never could have imagined. I opened Carlisle
Bowenwork in 2012\. For me, it's been a huge learning curve to run a large
Wellness Center, and bring new therapies to Central PA, but now, I can't
imagine having any other profession.

The only
natural extension of loving this work the way I do, is to begin teaching others
how to do it. 

There will
soon be more information about the Bowen curriculum that is now being developed
to teach Bowen as continuing education to massage therapists.

I live in
Boiling Springs, PA with my husband, two teenage boys, and one misbehaved dog.
