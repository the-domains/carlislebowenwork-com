# Meet the Owner

My name is Nancy Bittinger. I have been passionate
about the world of Alternative Health since 1993, when I first entered massage
school. My learning has never stopped since then.

When I took
my first Bowenwork Class in 2011, I knew that I had found something that was
going to change my life and the life of the people I work with. Bowenwork has
helped my clients in ways that I never could have imagined. I opened Carlisle
Bowenwork in 2012\. For me, it's been a huge learning curve to run a large
Wellness Center, and bring new therapies to Central PA, but now, I can't
imagine having any other profession.

Taking that
first Bowenwork class, was a profoundly
positive-life-altering-make-the-world-a-better-place, kind of decision. I feel
blessed and am thankful that this is the work I'm sharing with the world.

The only
natural extension of loving this work the way I do, is to begin teaching others
how to do it. Teaching has always been something I've done for "fun". I've
created couple's massage classes, taught infant massage classes, and taught
Girl Scout troops. At my church, I have been involved in every aspect of
religious education. I've taught every age group, including the youth group. I
also taught a 27-week sexual education class called "Our Whole Lives" to middle
schoolers! That takes a special kind of brave to do that, but I loved every
minute of it. Bringing two things that I'm so passionate about together;
Bowenwork and teaching, feels like my highest calling.

There will
soon be more information about the Bowen curriculum that is now being developed
to teach Bowen as continuing education to massage therapists.

I live in
Boiling Springs, PA with my husband, two teenage boys, and one misbehaved dog.
