# Bowenwork for Pain
Reduction and Improved Quality of Life

The benefits of deep tissue massage and
similar modalities are well-known for pain and stress reduction, but there is
another form of therapy that offers a subtle yet highly effective alternative
to the typical massage session. Bowenwork was introduced to the United States twenty
years ago and stands on its own in the field of bodywork. "Bowen is the only
modality that combines both physical and energetic elements to pinpoint stress
patterns held in the body," Nancy Bittinger of Carlisle Bowenwork says. "I do
not use massage oil, and a Bowen session is not a massage session. Clients, if
they prefer, can remain fully clothed," she adds.

The Bowen Technique, originated by Australian
native Tom Bowen in the 1950s, is based on an approach that aims to restore
harmony of the autonomic nervous system that is responsible for 80 percent of
the body's functions. Health and well-being can suffer when the nervous system
is in overdrive from stress; this state of prolonged fight or flight can
manifest in numerous ways including insomnia, migraines, chronic anxiety,
persistent pain and digestive distress. "Healing cannot happen until the
parasympathetic nervous system kicks in, the part that enables the body to
rest, digest and repair," Bittinger emphasizes. The heart of Bowenwork lies in
the body's ability to heal itself with gentle influence on the nervous system.

Prompting the nervous system to respond, Bowen
practitioners focus on observing fascia, widespread connective tissue that envelops
every part of the body---from the most superficial muscles to the deepest layers
comprising organs, bones and nerves. It is through this connective tissue that
a practitioner can decode the body's stress patterns. "I spend time feeling and
seeing patterns of tension before applying a few gentle moves. Then I allow the
body to remain still for a few moments before I continue with the client and
access changes and responses. Sometimes I will see a change in leg length or a
subtle change in the fascia itself. From there I know how to proceed,"
Bittinger explains. "People of all ages can receive the benefits of Bowen, and
sessions can be tailored to individual needs; clients who cannot lie flat on a
massage table can have treatments in the comfort of a chair," she adds.

Bowenwork practitioners see clients with a
vast range of health complaints, the most common being both acute and chronic pain.
Bowen's effect on long-standing issues can be profound, and results are
typically seen within one to three weeks. Migraines, PTSD, menopausal symptoms,
fibromyalgia and infant colic are just a few conditions that respond positively
to treatments. Bowenwork also promotes recovery after illness, trauma or
surgery. "Bowen has completely changed my own life," Bittinger says with conviction,
"It is that powerful."
