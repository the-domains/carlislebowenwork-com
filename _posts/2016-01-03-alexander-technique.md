For over 100 years AT has helped people rethink and reshape their movement.

Whether you are an actor, musician, dentist, or athlete, AT is a great tool to help find, explore, and discover freer and easier ways to move.

Come in and learn how to take the tension out of the things that you do every day.

Joe Schaefer, a soon-to-be-certified AT teacher, has spent the last 3 years in a 1600-hour teacher training course in Baltimore, Maryland.

For the past 5 years he has studied the Technique and has drastically changed how he uses his body.

Whether you are a musician, dentist, actor or athlete AT is great tool to help bring about the awareness and avoidance of habits of movement. Don't misuse your body!
