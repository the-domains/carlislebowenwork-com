# Alexander Technique

The Alexander Technique (AT) teaches you how to unlearn harmful habits of movement through thinking and choice.

AT is given in "lessons" as you become aware of and learn how to take the tension out of the things that you do every day by applying what is discovered throughout the lesson. Both table work and hands-on work in movement or "activity" are addressed. These can range from looking at how you sit at your desk to how you swim. Because of this, the Alexander Technique has helped people rethink and reshape their movement for over 100 years.

Whether you are an actor, musician, dentist, or athlete, AT is a great tool to help find, explore, and discover freer and easier ways to move.

Whether you are a musician, dentist, actor or athlete AT is great tool to help bring about the awareness and avoidance of habits of movement. Don't misuse your body!
