# Meet the Owner

My name is Nancy
Bittinger. I have been passionate about the world of Alternative Health since 1993,
when I first entered massage school. My learning has never stopped since then. 

When I took my first
Bowenwork Class in 2011, I knew that I had found something that was
going to change my life and the life of my clients. Bowenwork has helped my clients in ways that I never could have imagined. I opened Carlisle
Bowenwork in 2012\. For me,
it's been a huge learning curve to run a large Wellness Center, and bring new therapies
to Central PA, but now, I can't imagine having any other profession. 

I have to say that taking that first Bowenwork class, has been a profoundly positive, life altering, make the
world a better place, kind of decision. I feel blessed and am thankful that this is the work I'm sharing
with the world.

The only natural
extension of loving this work the way I do, is to begin teaching others how
to do it. Teaching has always been something I've done for "fun". I've created
couple's massage classes, taught infant massage classes, and taught Girl Scout
troops. At my church, I have been involved in every aspect of religious
education. I've taught every age group, including the youth group. I also
taught a 27-week sexual education class called "Our Whole Lives" to middle
schoolers! That takes a special kind of brave to do that, but I loved every
minute of it. Bringing two things that I'm so passionate about together,
Bowenwork and teaching, feels like my highest calling.

There will soon be more
information about the Bowen curriculum that is now being created to teach Bowen
as continuing education to massage therapists. 

I live in Boiling Springs,
PA with my husband, two teenage boys, and one misbehaved dog.
