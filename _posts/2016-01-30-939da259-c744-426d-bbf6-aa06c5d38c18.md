Nancy
Bittinger has been passionate about the world of Alternative Health since 1993,
when she entered massage school. Her learning has never stopped since then. 

When Nancy took her first
Bowenwork Class in 2011, she knew that she had just found something that was
going to change her life and the life of her clients. Bowenwork has helped her
clients in ways that she never could have imagined. Nancy opened Carlisle
Bowenwork in 2012, just one year after taking her first Bowen class. For her,
it's been a huge learning curve to run a large Wellness Center, and bring new therapies
to Central PA. Now, she can't imagine having any other profession. 

No other decision that Nancy
has made in her life has been so profoundly positive, life altering, make the
world a better place kind of decision, the way that taking her first Bowenwork
class was. She is thankful and blessed that this is the work she is sharing
with the world.

The only natural
extension of loving this work the way she does, is to begin teaching others how
to do it. Teaching has always been something she has done for "fun". She has created
couple's massage classes, taught infant massage classes, taught Girl Scout
troops, and at her church, she has been involved in every aspect of religious
education. She taught every age group, including the youth group. She also
taught a 27-week sexual education class called "Our Whole Lives" to middle
schoolers! That takes a special kind of brave to do that, but she loved every
minute of it. Bringing two things that she is so passionate about together,
Bowenwork and teaching, feels like her highest calling.

There will soon be more
information about the Bowen curriculum that is now being created to teach Bowen
as continuing education to massage therapists. 

Nancy lives in Boiling Springs,
PA with her husband, two teenage boys, and one misbehaved dog.
