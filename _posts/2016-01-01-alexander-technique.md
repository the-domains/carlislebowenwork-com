# Alexander Technique

The
Alexander Technique (AT) teaches you how to unlearn harmful habits of movement
through thinking and choice.

For
over 100 years AT has helped people rethink and reshape their movement. 

Whether
you are an actor, musician, dentist, or athlete, AT is a great tool to help
find, explore, and discover freer and easier ways to move.

Come
in and learn how to take the tension out of the things that you do every day.
