_I learned about Bowen
therapy around nine years ago while searching for relief for my chronic back
pain. I finally found a therapist about an hour and a half away from my home
and went to see if Bowen might help me. After just ONE session, I could tell
that something had happened to my body! I was very excited, but it was just not
possible for me to travel 1 1/2 hours with my 2 year old in tow to go for
continuing treatments. I have had massage and chiropractic work for 20 years
for my back issues on a monthly basis. While this helped a lot, it was always
painful ( massage). I was thrilled when Nancy opened 15 minutes from my house!
I have been seeing her for 1 1/2 years now, and my back has NEVER been better.
My job contributes to my problem and pain, so I still must go monthly for
treatment, but I am so happy that it is pain free treatment, and I feel so much
better. I am happy to say I have not had a therapeutic massage in all that
time, and I feel wonderful!!!! I am a true believer in the power and
effectiveness of Bowen therapy! -_

_I am glad I tried this
therapy. I did my research prior to going. Bowen therapy has been very
effective for thousands of clients so I wanted to try it as a resource to help
with my pain. I am very optimistic and will be returning on a regular basis._

_It takes more than one
visit usually, but it's worth it!_

_Try it, it is the best
feeling in the world. May take a day or so, but, you will feel wonderful. You
will also wonder what took you so long to do it. Take a risk, do it. You will
be a better feeling person for doing it._

_My time with Nancy was
the most relaxing that I can recall. It was a period of mindlessness yet full
awareness. I can't adequately explain my experience, but it is one that I'll
repeat. It was recommended to me by 2 friends who have visited at Bowenwork
repeatedly. One result was a relief from TMJ. I've always been a jaw clencher,
and I experienced freedom from that tension and overall muscular relaxation
that I never experienced before. If in doubt, go for it!_

_When I was first
diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, I was barely able to walk. My tremors were
so severe that I couldn't manage buttons or zippers. I heard about Bowenwork,
and though I was skeptical at first, I agreed to give it a try. After just one
session, I was able to walk without a cane, and the tremors were reduced by as
much as 75%. Frankly, I was astonished. I recently showed up for an appointment
with increased tremors and difficulty walking. Twenty minutes later, I was able
to walk more than a mile, and again the tremors improved markedly. I don't know
how or why it works, but for me, Bowenwork is nothing short of a miracle._

-Geneva, Carlisle

__

_I don't truly
understand how it really works but it does. I was amazed at how relaxed I felt.
The tension in my neck and shoulders was gone and that boost to my energy
helped me get back into my normal life. I didn't feel like I was so tired and
just needed to come home and go to bed. Everyone should give it a try._

-Tracy, York Springs

_When I began bringing
my (Autism Spectrum) son for Bowen treatments, I never expected to see results
as quickly as I did. Within a week, his talking seemed to be opening up and
improving. He was saying things we'd never heard him say before. He seemed more
engaged with the world around him and was also more relaxed._

-Becky, Mechanicsburg

_A Tribute to Bowenwork
Dec 10, 2011 is a day I will remember for a long time. I had to drive from
Carlisle to NJ and back that day and in the early morning, I awoke to take out
the dog and get the newspaper. While leaning over to put on my shoes (I wish it
were more of an heroic or strenuous activity), I felt a pop in my lower back
and a sudden painful spasm there. I stretched and it seemed to go away, so I
continued on my trip. By the time I arrived back home late that night, I was in
agony, with a constant pain in my left leg that shot down from my buttocks down
to my lower leg. It did not go away with rest. Subsequent investigation,
including an MRI, showed that I had a bulging disk in the L5 area of the spine
and a classic case of sciatica. The month of January 2012 was a nightmare, as I
could barely walk and spent most of my time in bed attempting to find a
comfortable resting position. Over the course of 2012 I tried all of the
conventional routes, including steroid injections, prescription and
non-prescription pain-killers, and conventional physical therapy. The
injections only seemed to last for 2 days before the pain came back. The
pain-killers dulled the pain but did not make it go away. Only the physical
therapy had an actual effect, but even this was incomplete. I found myself
functional but not cured. I was slowly resigning myself to a life with sciatic
pain as a constant distraction.\\r\\nIn the beginning of 2013, I saw an ad in the
local paper for a non-conventional therapy called Bowenworks. I was initially
sceptical, as my wife had a bad experience with chiropractic, and many
alternative therapies rely a lot on a placebo effect. However, at that point I
was completely frustrated with conventional approaches, so I figured that the
only thing I had to lose was a little money. I went to Carlisle Bowenwork and
scheduled an appointment. I found the session restful and intriguing. Basically
you lie on a comfortable massage table for about an hour, relaxing while the
therapist (Nancy Bittinger) periodically manipulates your spine and various
joints. Discussions with Nancy showed that it is based on sound and thorough
anatomical knowledge. Bowenworks is part of an approach that includes diet and
exercise. While far from cured after the first session, I did feel an
improvement, so I decided to continue. I am very glad that I did.\\r\\nIt is now
November 2013\. Over the course of the year things continued to improve and now
the sciatic pain is GONE. When I started, I was taking 2 Tramadol and 8x200mg
Ibuprofen daily. I am now taking no pain medication. I am able to walk and sit
without any pain. One of the things I noticed over the course of the year was
that the manipulation that Nancy does feet less intense as my body heals. She
is doing the same thing she did before, but my body has realigned itself. With
the sciatica essentially cured (as opposed to suppressed, which is what the
conventional therapies did), I am now pursuing Bowenwork as a solution to a bad
bunion on my left foot. Again conventional therapies are drastic (the standard
bunion surgery rips your foot apart). The Bowenwork approach is to realign
things, including the way I walk, and let the body heal. I am just in the
beginning stages of this, but the big toe already has more movement. In
summary, I am giving an enthusiastic testimonial for the effectiveness of
Bowenworks. My wife and I go regularly to relax._
