  When I took my first Bowenwork Class in 2011, I knew that I had found
  something that was going to change my life and the life of the people I work
  with. Bowenwork has helped my clients in ways that I never could have
  imagined. I opened Carlisle Bowenwork in 2012. For me, it’s been a huge
  learning curve to run a large Wellness Center, and bring new therapies to
  Central PA, but now, I can’t imagine having any other profession.

# Meet the Owner

## My name is Nancy Bittinger. I have been passionate about the world of Alternative Health since 1993, when I first entered massage school. My learning has never stopped since then.

When I took my first Bowenwork Class in 2011, I knew that I had found something that was going to change my life and the life of the people I work with. Bowenwork has helped my clients in ways that I never could have imagined. I opened Carlisle Bowenwork in 2012\. For me, it's been a huge learning curve to run a large Wellness Center, and bring new therapies to Central PA, but now, I can't imagine having any other profession.

Taking that first Bowenwork class, was a profoundly positive-life-altering-make-the-world-a-better-place, kind of decision. I feel blessed and am thankful that this is the work I'm sharing with the world.
