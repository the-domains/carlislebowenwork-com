  When I took my first Bowenwork Class in 2011, I

  could have imagined. I opened Carlisle Bowenwork in 2012. For me, it’s been a

  huge learning curve to run a large Wellness Center, and bring new therapies to

  Central PA, but now, I can’t imagine having any other profession.

## My name is Nancy Bittinger. I have been passionate about the world of Alternative Health since 1993, when I first entered massage school. My learning has never stopped since then.

**When I took my first Bowenwork Class in 2011**, I
knew that I had found something that was going to change my life and the life
of the people I work with. Bowenwork has helped my clients in ways that I never
could have imagined. I opened Carlisle Bowenwork in 2012\. For me, it's been a
huge learning curve to run a large Wellness Center, and bring new therapies to
Central PA, but now, I can't imagine having any other profession.

**Taking that first Bowenwork class**, was a profoundly
positive-life-altering-make-the-world-a-better-place, kind of decision. I feel
blessed and am thankful that this is the work I'm sharing with the world.

**The only natural extension** of loving this work the
way I do, is to begin teaching others how to do it. 

**There will soon be more information** about the Bowen
curriculum that is now being developed to teach Bowen as continuing education
to massage therapists.
