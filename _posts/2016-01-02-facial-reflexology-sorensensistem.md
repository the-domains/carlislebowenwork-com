It helps to support the regulation of blood,
hormones, lymph, and boosts your immune system. 

As a complementary modality, it can be safely
applied regardless of other treatments that may be in progress.

It will help you to
feel better with less muscle tension plus have a more radiant complexion.

Mary enjoys helping those she
serves to reach independence in all facets of their
lives using a client-centered approach. Over the past three years, she has been
driven to personally explore the integration of complementary and alternative
treatment modalities (CAM) not only for her own self-care, but also to
implement during treatment with those she serves within the scope of her
practice.
