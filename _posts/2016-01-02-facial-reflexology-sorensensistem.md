Facial
Reflexology Sorensensistem(tm) uses touch stimulation of the muscles, zones and
reflex points on the face to restore energy balance throughout the body.

As a complementary modality, it can be safely
applied regardless of other treatments that may be in progress.

It will help you to
feel better with less muscle tension plus have a more radiant complexion.

It helps to support the regulation of blood,
hormones, lymph, and boosts your immune system. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/62c279a0-c5a2-464c-b5bd-505f99c6f2a8.jpg)

Mary
Alexis has practiced within the field of occupational therapy since 1999 in various
settings with individuals across their lifespan with complex medical
histories.

Mary enjoys helping those she
serves to reach independence in all facets of their
lives using a client-centered approach. Over the past three years, she has been
driven to personally explore the integration of complementary and alternative
treatment modalities (CAM) not only for her own self-care, but also to
implement during treatment with those she serves within the scope of her
practice.
